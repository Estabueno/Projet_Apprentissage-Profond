Rolando, he's my father.
Good morning, Mr. Levoux.
Nice to meet you.
Leave me alone with him for a second.
I can't wait to talk, kid.
Don't worry, honey, he just wants to talk to her.
Let me explain.
For the past 16 years, the protection of my daughter has been my responsibility and only my responsibility.
But now, for the first time in my life, it's gonna become your responsibility.
Don't screw up.
Or your mom's gonna cry every day of her life by pushing her darling son into a wheelchair.
